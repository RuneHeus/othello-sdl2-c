# Othello
This project implements the classic Othello (Reversi) game in C using the SDL2 library for the graphical interface. The game allows two players to place and flip stones following Othello rules, skip turns, or quit via keyboard input. At the start of each turn, the full board state is saved persistently in a text file. The program can be launched with command-line options to either resume from a saved field file or start a new game with arbitrary board dimensions. The design leverages dynamic memory allocation to support flexible board sizes and ensures clear separation between game logic and GUI code.
